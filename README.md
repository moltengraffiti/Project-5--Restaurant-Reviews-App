## Project Aim

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, you will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In **Stage One**, you will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

## How to view the Project

1. Clone the project to your local environment.
2. You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` in Main.js and  Restaurant_info.js with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).
3. Host the project through a local server.
4. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/).
